/**
 @brief	APSAction defines base control flow of creating and running cocos2d actions.
 
 1. When parent symbol(APSSymbol) receives trigger message for this action, the symbol checks if there is a running action with the same actionType property and the same target graphic. If there is, symbol compares priority properties of the two actions, and one of them is interrupted.
 2. To trigger this action, parent symbol calls run() method.
 3. If cocos2d::CCAction object is not created yet, it is created by getCCAction() method.
 4. run() method calls runAction() method of target graphic, and cocos2d::CCAction begins execution.
 5. At the beginning of cocos2d::CCAction's execution, startFunc() method of APSAction is called.
 6. startFunc() calls notifyStart() of parent symbol(APSSymbol).
 7. APSAction object is added to runningActions set in symbol.
 8. At the end of cocos2d::CCAction's execution, stopFunc() method of APSAction is called.
 9. stopFunc() calls notifyStop() of parent symbol.
 10. APSAction object is removed from runningActions set in symbol.
 
 - The all APSAction objects have targetGraphic no matter they are graphic action or not. Generally none graphic action's target is parentSymbol.
